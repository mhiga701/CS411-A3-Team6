TRIPMIXER!

**Inspired by Paul Lamere's 'Roadtrip Mixtape' https://www.spotify.dev/community/showcase/roadtrip-mixtape/**

A curated playlist generator that utilizes the Spotify API and Google Maps API. Enter an origin and destination into the map (with autocomplete) and choose your form of transit (walk, bike, drive, or public transportation). In return, you will get a route for your trip, an estimated duration, and the option to generate a playlist for the length of the trip.

Playlists are curated to each user's short term (roughly the last month) top tracks and artists using the Spotify API's recommendations endpoint.

**Note**
The generated playlist lengths are variable and may fall slightly short or long of the estimated travel time returned by the map. This is because playlists are created by adding tracks, not by specifying a time parameter. Thus, conversions are done to calculate the general amount of songs needed to hit the estimated travel time, and depending on the songs generated by the recommendations endpoint, they actual length of the created playlist can deviate slightly from the exact travel time.

Tech stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
