Updated Ideas on the Project:

1. Scrap the weather api, 2 apis is enough work as is
2. The spotify api is successfully working, now just need to implement the maps api to get distance between endpoints
3. Spotify has an upper limit on the length of playlists that the api can generate (100 tracks in a single playlist)
    3i. Spotify generates playlists by number of tracks and not time, so we will use the average time of a song in seconds as a way to convert the
    length of a user's trip into a rough number of tracks that should be in the playlist
    3ii. The average song length according to 2020 spotify data is 3 min and 17 seconds (197 seconds), giving us a rough upper limit playlist length of 
    5 and a half hours. We can control the mode of transportation on the maps api, so if we focus on walking distance, that will give higher user satisfaction
    as far as playlists being long enough for a walk vs. a drive
    3iii. Maybe we can advertise it as playlists for your hot girl walk? that hits a large market of genz-->millenial ages

4. Must implement the database, use mongo to store user data
    4i. Main data to store, saved/frequent locations, past playlists, account info

5. If we have time, implement a mood function for spotify music using the api's data on valence, energy, rhythm, etc. (follow MOOD web app for ideas no source code but still useful)
