User Story 2

I am an avid music listener who almost always has Spotify on in the background, but would love to have some sort of playlist creator that does the work for me since I find making a playlist on Spotify to be kind of tedious. I would like it to consider the kinds of music that I currently like by allowing me to log in to my account, but also recommend new genres to me that can be either completely random or based on trends from my personal listening experience. Hopefully, this app will allow me to broaden my music taste and discover new artists.
