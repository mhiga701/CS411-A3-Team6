User Story 3

Since I am very in touch with my emotions, I see music as a medium for me to express how I am feeling, or to help me feel what I want to feel. Sometimes, the weather largely can affect my mood both positively and negatively, and I would like my Spotify playlists to be able to capture such emotions associated with the weather and curate a playlist around it. This could be both for every day playlists, and for road trips. I would find it especially fun on a road trip to have more upbeat and happy music playing as we drive to a sunny place, and have more somber, mellow vibes when approaching a more gloomy, rural area.
