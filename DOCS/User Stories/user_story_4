User Story 4

As a person who goes on road trips often, I obsess over making the perfect road trip playlist so that there is neither a silent moment nor an ad break. In the past, I have made my own playlists in an attempt to match the given duration of the trip leading up to the day that I actually drive, but sometimes weather and traffic conditions make my playlist times inaccurate. I think it would be great if I could input the endpoints of my road trip and the app could generate a playlist for my Spotify account that would be the exact duration of the trip. An even bigger plus for extra brownie points would be to analyze possible factors that could delay the trip and queue songs if necessary to keep the vibes high until I have reached my destination.
