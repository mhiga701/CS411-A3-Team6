User Story 5

As a user, I would like to be able to save the generated playlists under my Spotify account so that I can always come back to it. Once I give the app input, I would imagine that it first generates an appropriate playlist and then links it to my account. If it can't be saved under my Spotify account directly, I would like to be able to create an account on the app that I could easily log into and access those playlists.
