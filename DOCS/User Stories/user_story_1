User Story 1

As a Spotify user, I want to be able to auto-generate playlists that fit the mood of my current roadtrip. It would be kind of like playing the radio but with general requests. Most of the time my personal playlists and radio only accomodate my own tastes so I want to be able to mix things up according to the overall mood of the trip and the other passengers. Spotify has a pretty good playlist search, but I find it inadequate sometimes. One reason why Spotify's playlist search doesn't work well for me is because the playlists are usually constrained to a single genre, but I would like all kinds of genres mixed into the playlist. Or, if it is a user-made playlist, it is bound to be too short and in accordance to their personal tastes. Plus, when I type in something along the lines "summer road trip," there are upwards of 30 playlists to choose from and I end up not wanting to pick one. That's why a generator would come in handyâ€”it's quick, unique, and assorted. To a certain extent, the songs should correspond to the atmosphere of the trip. For example, if it is a cold gloomy day, I don't want a super summery, up beat song. That said, if it is a summer roadtrip, I don't want to listen to anything too somber.
